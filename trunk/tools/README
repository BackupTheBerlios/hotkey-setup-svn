Tools for handling hotkeys
==========================

 * writekeymaps.py reads in keyboard seetting from various sources and 
   generates hotkey-setup compatible keyboard maps
 * xkbd_evdev.py writes out xkbd keycodes table for the evdev driver
 * xkbd_linux_symbols.py writes out xkbd symbol tables for kbd and evdev driver
 * xkb_alias.py speaking aliases for evdev keycodes - doesn't work - obsolete
 
  

Libraries
=========

hotkeys.py
----------

Hold classes and tables with names of keys in X11 and kernel/console level and
convertions between them.

readers/
--------

Contains modules to read files from various projects that deal with hotkeys:

 * hotkeysetup.py http://developer.berlios.de/projects/hotkey-setup/ or 
   ../hotkey-setup
 * keytouch.py http://keytouch.sourceforge.net/index.php
 * lineak.py http://lineak.sourceforge.net/
 * xkbd.py X11 configuration 
   http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software_2fXKeyboardConfig

The these modules are used by writekeymaps.py. To make lineak and keytouch 
work you need symbolic links to the directory containing the lineakkb.def and
the keytouch keyboard files names lineakd and keytouch in this directory.
